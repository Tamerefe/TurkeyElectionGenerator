## Data Information

1. The following points are taken into consideration when conducting surveys:

    - The results are listed in reverse chronological order based on the date the survey was conductedâ€”that is, with the most recent survey at the top of the table.
    - The highest percentage in each poll is shown in bold text with the cell background in the color of the leading candidate or alliance. In case of a tie, the cells of the two sides with the most votes are colored.
    - The rightmost difference column shows the percentage difference between the two sides with the highest percentage.
    - If the company conducting the survey is actively registered in Turkey and the survey results can be confirmed from reliable sources, it is added to the list regardless of how biased or unbiased its results appear.
    - If the company conducting the survey has political connections that can be confirmed from reliable sources, it is stated as a note.
